🐢 Turtle Race Game (Python Turtle)

This is a fun turtle race game built using Python's Turtle graphics module. The user places a bet on which turtle (by color) will win the race. 
Once the race begins, the turtles move forward by random amounts, and a popup at the end will announce the winner and tell you if you won or lost the bet.

🎮 How to Play

   _"Which turtle will win the race? Enter a color:"_  
   Choose one of the following colors:
   - red
   - orange
   - yellow
   - blue
   - purple
   - green

2. After entering your bet, the race begins automatically.
3. Turtles move randomly forward.
4. When one turtle crosses the finish line, a popup shows the result.
5. The game ends when you click anywhere in the turtle window.
