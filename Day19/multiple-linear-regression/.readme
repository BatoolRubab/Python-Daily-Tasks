Project Structure
Data Cleaning: Removal of categorical and unnecessary features.
Visualization: Scatter matrix and individual feature plots.
Standardization: Features are standardized using StandardScaler.
Model Training: Linear regression is applied using two features:
Engine Size
Fuel Consumption (MPG)

Evaluation:
Coefficients and intercept (both standardized and original scale)
Model predictions vs actual values
3D Visualization: Regression plane plotted along with test data points.
Single Feature Models: Additional plots and models trained on individual features for comparison.
